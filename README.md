# BIG-MART-SALES-PREDICTION
Big Mart Sales Forecasting for Strategic Inventory Management- Group Project for BSAN775 - Introduction to Business Analytics -Wichita State University
Overview:
Developed a predictive model to forecast product sales at various outlets to optimize inventory management and increase profitability. Utilized machine learning techniques and advanced algorithms to analyze sales data and understand the influence of product and outlet characteristics on sales.

Key Contributions:

Data Acquisition & Preprocessing: Collected data from a public dataset, performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and engineered features such as Outlet_Age to enhance model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data, leading to insights for model refinement.
Model Development: Implemented various machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost. Achieved the best results using Decision Trees with a Correlation Coefficient of 0.7209 on the test set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Relative Absolute Error (RAE), and Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE), with the Decision Trees model outperforming others.
Further Tuning: Explored different cross-validation techniques and ensemble models to optimize the final model for deployment.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Kaggle dataset.
